## ✨ Overview
The core idea revolves around computing the private exponent **`K`**:
- We have `new_k = K = old_k · g`.
- The challenge “gift” gives us a fast way to validate candidates for `K`.
- We exploit the structure **`old_k = p1 · p2`** where `p1`, `p2` are **28-bit primes**.  
  There are **exactly 7,027,290 primes** in `[2^27, 2^28 − 1]`, making search feasible.

> [!TIP]
> Once `old_k` is identified, compute `K = old_k · g`, verify with the **gift** relation, and decrypt.

---

## 🧩 Challenge Setup
You’re given:
- `n` (RSA-like modulus),
- `g` (multiplier),
- `gift` (verification value),
- `cipher` (ciphertext as integer).

Hidden structure guaranteed by the challenge:
- `old_k = p1 · p2` with 28-bit primes `p1`, `p2`,
- `K = old_k · g` is the **private exponent**.

---

## 🚀 Approach

### High-Level Flow
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Start] --> B[Generate 28-bit primes]
  B --> C[Search/derive old_k = p1·p2]
  C --> D[Compute K = old_k · g]
  D --> E{Verify: pow(K, 13, n) == gift?}
  E -- yes --> F[Decrypt: m = pow(cipher, K, n)]
  E -- no --> B
  F --> G[Parse bytes → UTF-8]
  G --> H[Done]
```

### Key Moves
- 🔍 **Prime space**: iterate/enumerate 28-bit primes efficiently (segmented sieve or fast primality).
- 🧮 **Candidate testing**: use the **gift** check to quickly validate the derived `K`.
- ⚡ **Decrypt**: once verified, compute `m = pow(cipher, K, n)` and decode.

> [!NOTE]
> The gift check used here is `pow(K, 13, n) == gift`. Replace `13` with whatever the challenge specifies if different.

## 📈 Results

**Recovered factors & key**
- `p1 = 233679967`  
- `p2 = 171077047`  
- `K  = 39977278697417449`

**Verification**
```text
pow(K, 13, n) == gift  →  OK ✅
```

**Decryption**
```text
m = pow(cipher, K, n)
→ plaintext bytes: b'd4rkc0de{att3nding_cl4ss3s_paid_off}'
→ plaintext (utf-8): d4rkc0de{att3nding_cl4ss3s_paid_off}
```

> 🏁 **Flag**: `d4rkc0de{att3nding_cl4ss3s_paid_off}`

## ▶️ Quickstart

### 1) Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2) (Optional) Prep a virtualenv
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scriptsctivate
```

### 3) Run the reference solver
Edit `solve.py` with your **`n`**, **`g`**, **`gift`**, **`cipher`**, then:
```bash
python3 solve.py
```

## 🧪 Reference `solve.py`
> Replace the placeholders for `n`, `g`, `gift`, and `cipher` with the real challenge values.

```python
# solve.py

# === Challenge constants (fill these) ===
n = ...           # RSA-like modulus (int)
g = ...           # multiplier for old_k (int)
gift = ...        # verification value (int)
cipher = ...      # ciphertext as int

# === Recovered values from the search ===
p1 = 233679967
p2 = 171077047

old_k = p1 * p2
K = old_k * g

# Verify against the 'gift' relation
assert pow(K, 13, n) == gift, "Verification failed: wrong K or constants."

# Decrypt
m_int = pow(cipher, K, n)
m_bytes = m_int.to_bytes((m_int.bit_length() + 7) // 8, "big")
try:
    print("Recovered plaintext:", m_bytes.decode("utf-8"))
except UnicodeDecodeError:
    print("Recovered plaintext bytes:", m_bytes)
```

## ⚙️ Performance Tips

- 🧰 **Prime generation**: Use a **segmented sieve** to enumerate all 28-bit primes quickly; cache to disk for reuse.
- 🧠 **Vectorized checks**: Batch modular operations when possible; Python’s built-in `pow(base, exp, mod)` is highly optimized.
- 🧵 **Parallelism**: Multiprocess prime work; shard the search space by ranges or by hashing primes to workers.
- 💾 **Caching**: Persist candidate sets and intermediate checks to skip repeated work during iterations.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
Huge thanks to the challenge authors for the elegant structure and the **gift** relation that makes the brute-force path practical.  
Made with ❤️ and a lot of `pow()` calls.
