# 🧩 FRSA (Frequency RSA)

At first glance, this challenge looks like an **RSA** problem — but in reality, it’s a **monoalphabetic substitution** cipher.  
The script encrypts each character independently as:

`c = (ord(ch))^e mod n`


and outputs the list of residues.

Because each character is processed separately, every plaintext symbol maps to a single, fixed ciphertext value.  
In our case, the plaintext is **uppercased**, so if we take the set of distinct ciphertext integers \(X\), we get **27 unique symbols** — corresponding to the **26 English letters plus the space**.

## 🧠 Principle

The intended method of solving this challenge is **frequency analysis**.  
We rank the ciphertext values by how often they occur, and then map them to the expected frequency order of English characters:

```
 ETIASNHORDMFLCGUYBWKVPQZXJ
```

(Space is the most frequent character.)

Hence the challenge’s name: **FRSA** — short for **Frequency RSA**.

## 🔍 First Result

Applying this direct frequency mapping gives the following intermediate text:

```

```

This text isn’t yet readable — the ciphertext isn’t long enough for letter frequencies to stabilize perfectly, so some mappings are still off.

## 🧩 Improving the Decryption

To refine the result, you can use online **monoalphabetic substitution solvers**:

- 🔗 [dCode — Monoalphabetic Substitution](https://www.dcode.fr/substitution-monoalphabetique)  
- 🔗 [quipqiup](https://quipqiup.com/)

These tools can use patterns and digraphs to complete the decryption automatically.

## ✅ Final Plaintext

Using these tools, we recover the intended plaintext:

```
