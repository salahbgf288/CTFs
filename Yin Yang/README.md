From ancient philosophy to modern thought, Yin and Yang represent balance, duality, and harmony of opposites. This image contains a secret that embodies these principles. Can you find balance in chaos?

From the picture we can extract two lists: 
yin=[188, 125, 135, 65, 97, 24, 39, 210, 40, 181, 215, 126,200, 223, 231, 91, 38, 207, 165, 117, 149, 157, 126]
yang=[219, 15, 232, 37, 15, 119, 92, 230, 28, 141, 229, 74, 240, 239, 212, 105, 21, 253, 149, 71, 166, 165, 3]

The first thing that someone can think of is to xor the two lists and see what he can obtain: 
[103, 114, 111, 100, 110, 111, 123, 52, 52, 56, 50, 52, 56, 48, 51, 50, 51, 50, 48, 50, 51, 56, 125]

This result in Ascii gives us the flag: 
grodno{448248032320238}
